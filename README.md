# Blockly Tooling

A custom Blockly app needs to:
- define custom blocks
- define toolboxes of common and custom blocks
- define workspace settings, starting blocks, rules
- define custom generators
- install and configure Blockly plugins and extensions

This project tries to streamline all that into one place for dev and testing, with an import/export story to interop with tooling and production exports for embedding in other apps.
